# Optoelectronic_Imaging_Device_CAD_Experiment.
This is the CAD program for my optoelectronic imaging technology experiment course.

Using the finite difference method and the successive over-relaxation (SOR) iteration method as theoretical basis, 
simulate the half meridian electric field distribution of an image intensifier with specific structural parameters 
and precision. To visually analyze the distribution of electric fields in the system, output equipotential lines 
and potentials along the axis, and export relevant parameters to a specified file. This article uses Visual Studio 
as the development environment, C++ as the programming language, and the EasyX library for graphical drawing.
